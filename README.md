Hi, I am a fourth year engineering student at the French engineering school [Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en) where I am learning general engineering with a focus on computer sciences.
I am interested in various domains of computer sciences with a focus on artificial intelligence/machine learning.
